# Recipe Book (using PERN Stack)

This Recipe Book was our final project in the course "465P/565 â€“ Full Stack Web Development" at Portland State University under the guidance of professor "Caterina Paun". We utilized the PERN stack i.e (Postgres, Express, React, Node.js) to accomplish this task. The Recipe book is a replica of a cookbook, which consists of different varieties of recipes (Around 268), instructions and information about preparation and servings of food.

## Motivation to build this app! 
`Learning to cook is one of the important aspects of life which enables a person to be independent.
Often times we find recipe website which are cluttered with too much information.
Thus, we aim to build a minimalistic simple and easy to use website for cooking beginners life ourselves!`
